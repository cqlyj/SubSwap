# **P2P Subscription Economy dApp**

## **üéØ Problem:**

Traditional **subscription models (Netflix, Spotify, Patreon, etc.)** have:  
üî¥ **No resellability** ‚Äì If you cancel early, you lose access with no refunds.  
üî¥ **High platform fees** ‚Äì Middlemen (Apple, Google, Patreon) take 15-30%.  
üî¥ **Lack of transparency** ‚Äì No on-chain proof of how payments are distributed.  
üî¥ **Limited sharing** ‚Äì Users can‚Äôt legally transfer unused subscriptions.

## **üí° Solution:**

A **Web3-powered subscription marketplace** where:  
‚úÖ **Users can buy, sell, or share subscriptions** as **NFTs.**  
‚úÖ **Smart contracts handle recurring payments** via stablecoins like **USDC.**  
‚úÖ **Subscription owners can resell access** to others before expiration.  
‚úÖ **Content creators receive fair payments** without platform middlemen.

# **üõ† How It Works**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Subscription NFTs (SFTs)**

- Instead of centralized accounts, users **own subscriptions as Semi-Fungible Tokens (ERC-1155 SFTs).**
- Each NFT represents **a subscription period** (e.g., 1-month Netflix access).
- **Users can transfer or resell** these NFTs before they expire.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Payment & Automation**

- **Stablecoins (USDC on Polygon/Arbitrum)** handle **recurring payments.**
- Smart contracts **auto-renew subscriptions** if the user has sufficient balance.
- Users can choose **one-time payments, auto-renewal, or P2P transfer.**

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ P2P Marketplace**

- Users who **don‚Äôt need the subscription anymore** can **list it for sale.**
- New buyers can **purchase unused subscription periods at a discount.**
- This enables **secondary markets** for digital services, reducing waste.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue Distribution & Transparency**

- Smart contracts ensure **creators receive a fair share** instantly.
- **No middlemen fees** (Apple/Google usually take 15-30%).
- Users can see **transparent on-chain revenue distribution.**
